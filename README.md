# cw-event-logger

Event Logging using Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Cloud Storage and BigQuery


Usage: The code is automatically deployed to google cloud run, the endpoint is https://cw-pubquery-service-hzqzkoxvpq-uc.a.run.app/ for both get and post
If you are to test the code locally, it may prompt you to have access to the cloud project...

The master repository is for deployment only.

See https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started if you want to test locally, you need to authenticate to google cloud and also have the access to the project.
